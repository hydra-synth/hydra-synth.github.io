      <description>How can I livecode Hydra without showing the code over the visuals? # by Flor de Fuego, Geikha&#xA;Use Flok: # Open https://flok.cc/ and create a session with hydra as a target. Now that you have your own Hydra session, with its own URL (it automatically changes on your browser&amp;rsquo;s nav bar), open it in one more tab. Enter the session in both tabs. You can disable Hydra on one of them if you want to (this would also lower resource demand).</description>
