      <description>Textures # by Naoto Hieda&#xA;In this chapter, we discuss textures or patterns, separately from colors or movements. Most of the snippets have low saturation in order to separate textures from other effects.&#xA;Oscillator # osc(freq,sync,offset) is one of the basic sources to create a texture. The first argument determines the frequency (i.e., how packed the stripes are), the second for the sync (i.e., the scroll speed), and the third for the offset, which adds color to the pattern.</description>

      <description>frames and timing # by geikha&#xA;Using the update function # There&amp;rsquo;s a function in the Hydra API called update. This function runs at the beginning of every frame render right before the values for time and a.fft are calculated. If you are familiar with Processing or p5, you can think of update as Hydra&amp;rsquo;s equivalent to the draw function. Using update can be very useful for creating generative visuals (generative in the sense of controlling visual elements with values that evolve through time either randomly or following certain rules).</description>

      <description>Using iteration and conditionals to create patches # by geikha&#xA;Note # For this tutorial we&amp;rsquo;ll be assuming you&amp;rsquo;ve already learned by your own means what iteration and conditionals are in a programming context.&#xA;Iteration : automatically generate patches # As you may know from regular programming, or other creative coding environments such as p5, iteration helps us repeat some operation(s) many times to achieve a specific goal. Maybe you would like to layer many similar objects but with slightly different values, and you want so many of them that writing each one manually isn&amp;rsquo;t desirable.</description>

      <description>JavaScript Guide # This guide is made for users who are new to JavaScript or coding in general and would like to dive into these topics. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to fully understand what&amp;rsquo;s here to use Hydra. If you&amp;rsquo;re just starting with Hydra and you have no coding experience, we recommend you experiment with Hydra a bit before reading this.&#xA;Comments # // This is a one line comment Most programming languages have implemented in them a feature commonly referred as comments.</description>
