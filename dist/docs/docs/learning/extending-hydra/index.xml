      <description>extensions # The Hydra community has put together many hydra-synth extensions which you can load into your sketches. This can be done using the loadScript function. Some of them add more sources, transforms, others have more intricate functionalities. There&amp;rsquo;s also a repository of extensions which you can load easily inside the editor by pressing the puzzle piece icon. Here we present some of the most used extensions:&#xA;hydra-midi # by Arnoson # hydra-midi is one of the most used extensions for Hydra.</description>

      <description>other libraries # Hydra is written in JavaScript, and compatible with many other JavaScript libraries. The hydra web editor executes JavaScript directly in the browser, so it is possible to load many other libraries and scripts directly in the browser.&#xA;p5.js # p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is pre-loaded on the Hydra editor with a wrapper that makes it easier to use inside the website.</description>

      <description>custom glsl # Using custom GLSL functions # Hydra is built using GLSL (a language for generating a program, or shader, that runs directly on the graphics card using WebGl). Each javascript function in hydra corresponds directly to a snippet of shader code. There are four possible types in hydra: src, coord (geometry), combine (blend), combineCoord (modulate). Each string of functions is composited based on its type into a single string of fragment shader code.</description>
